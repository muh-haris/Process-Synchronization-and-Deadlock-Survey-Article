# Process-Synchronization-and-Deadlock-Survey-Article
Process synchronization and deadlock are foundational concepts in computer science, playing a pivotal role in ensuring the correctness and efficiency of concurrent systems. This comprehensive survey article offers a thorough exploration of process synchronization and deadlock in the context of concurrent computing and operating systems. This survey thoroughly discussed about the core synchronization mechanisms like semaphores, mutexes and locks. It also addresses some common challenges in process synchronization, such as deadlocks, starvation, and priority inversion. It traces the historical development of these concepts, providing insights into how they have evolved over time and highlighting key ideas that have shaped the field. The survey critically examines previous approaches and methodologies used to study process synchronization and deadlock. It compares different ways that people have looked at this problem and tries to understand what they did well and what they could have done better. This helps us understand the problem better and gives us new ideas for how to solve it. The proposed model is detailed with a focus on technical integration. Implementation details, code snippets, and insightful case studies are provided to illustrate the practical application and effectiveness of the new approach. These examples show how it can be used in the real world and help people understand how to use it themselves. Through an examination of many references from academic journals, conference proceedings, and authoritative books, this survey aims to be a valuable resource for researchers, practitioners, and students seeking a comprehensive understanding of the subject.
